# tula-closeline-db

Closeline database migrations and typed schema, one Postgres schema per service

Part of Closeline. The hub repo [`tula-closeline`](https://github.com/Tula-Solutions/tula-closeline)
holds the glossary, decision records, plans, issues and the shared workflow setup.

## Getting started

```bash
gh auth setup-git      # once: lets git fetch the private tula-closeline-* libraries over https
bun install
bun run verify
```

Standards: `AGENTS.md` (this repo) and `.claude/COMMON.md` (shared).

## Database

One Postgres per Region; each service owns one schema (`auth`, `core`, `playbook`) and writes it
through its own login role (`closeline_auth`, `closeline_core`, `closeline_playbook`). Migrations
are generated and applied only from this repo and never edited once on `develop`. Never
`drizzle-kit push`.

```bash
docker compose up -d --wait         # Postgres 18; set POSTGRES_PORT if 5432 is taken
export DATABASE_URL=postgres://closeline_owner:closeline_owner_local@127.0.0.1:5432/closeline
bun run db:migrate                  # applies pending migrations as the owner role
```

The first start runs `docker/postgres/init.sh`, which creates the owner and service roles from
`docker/postgres/init.sql` (local passwords only, set in `docker-compose.yml`). To run it again,
`docker compose down -v`.

Integration tests need Postgres from the compose file. With none of the four connection
variables in `.env.example` set they use the compose defaults (port 5432, or `POSTGRES_PORT`), so
this is the whole of what CI runs:

```bash
docker compose up -d --wait && bun run test:integration
```

Set all four variables and `DATABASE_URL_ADMIN`, a superuser, together to test against another
Postgres (`DATABASE_URL_ADMIN` alone, or a partial set, is refused). The suites drop stale test
objects and alter roles, so they refuse any host that is not loopback unless
`ALLOW_NON_LOCAL_TEST_DATABASE=1` is set; use that only for a disposable database. The suites cover
role confinement, tenant isolation, the client's handling of lost connections, the migration
runner and the catalog check below.

`bun run db:migrate` fails unless it connects as `closeline_owner` (default privileges belong to
the role that creates a table), and gives its session a 10 second `lock_timeout`, so `ENABLE` or
`FORCE ROW LEVEL SECURITY` fails instead of queueing behind a long transaction. Retry it when the
database is quiet.

A data backfill on a table with forced row-level security must set the Organization for every
batch (`withOrganization`, or `select set_config('app.organization_id', ..., true)` in the
batch's transaction). Without it the policy matches nothing, and the `UPDATE` or `DELETE` reports
success with zero rows changed.

`bun run db:check:rls` (with `DATABASE_URL` set) fails when any table lacks `organization_id`,
forced row-level security, or exactly the policy `tenantRlsStatements` writes, unless it is on
`NON_TENANT_TABLES` (the `auth` tables, each with its reason in `NON_TENANT_TABLE_REASONS`). It
scans every schema except `public` and drizzle's own, so a table in a schema that is not `auth`,
`core` or `playbook` is a gap, and so is a `closeline_*` role that is a superuser or has
`BYPASSRLS`. The integration suite runs the same check, so a migration that
forgets `tenantRlsStatements` fails CI. The tests that change role attributes connect as the
compose superuser, or as `DATABASE_URL_ADMIN` when you point at another Postgres.

Changing the schema: edit `src/schema/`, run `bun run db:generate`, read the SQL, commit it.
`bun run db:check` (part of `verify`) fails when the schema and the migrations disagree, when a
migration that exists on `origin/develop` (or `MIGRATIONS_BASE_REF`) was edited or deleted, or when
the journal's `when` values do not strictly increase. Without that ref it warns locally and fails
when `CI` is set. A new
tenant table carries `organization_id` and runs the statements from `tenantRlsStatements` in its
migration; tenant data is read and written only inside `withOrganization(db, organizationId, fn)`.

## The auth schema

The `auth` schema is tula-auth's tables, copied (ADR 0005) with the same names and columns so
`tula-closeline-auth` runs the same code: 30 tables, from `workspaces` and `projects` down to
`users`, `sessions`, `signing_keys` and the webhook outbox. Migration `0001` is tula-auth's 35
migrations at their latest state, with `tula` renamed `auth` and `tula_app` renamed
`closeline_auth`.

- Auth users are global within a Region, so no auth table has `organization_id` and none is under
  the Organization policy. They are on `NON_TENANT_TABLES`, each with a reason. Organizations,
  Teams and roles live in core.
- The tables are instead scoped to an auth environment by forced row-level security on
  `environment_id`, reading the setting `tula.environment_id` (`ENVIRONMENT_SETTING`). Run auth
  queries inside `withEnvironment(db, environmentId, fn)`. `api_keys` and the control plane
  (`workspaces`, `projects`, `environments`, `instance_audit_logs`) have no such policy.
- Only `closeline_auth` can reach the schema, with tula-auth's least-privilege grants: no
  `DELETE` on the control plane, no `UPDATE` on the audit logs, column-level `UPDATE` on the
  outbox and the counters. `auth.applied_migrations()` is the only way it reads migration history.
- One fixed project per Region is data, not schema: nothing in the tables limits a Region to one
  project. The auth service must bootstrap one workspace and one project, with a development and a
  production environment, and refuse to create more.
